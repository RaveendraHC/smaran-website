                SJCE has successfully completed World Bank assisted TEQIP – I scheme of Government of India as a lead institute in which the emphasis has been on infrastructure and is part of TEQIP II scheme in which priority is on post graduate education, research and innovation.<br/>
                Smaran  has collaborated with Chemistry Department   of SJCE .  Continuous research and development  is being done in field of Bio-mulch. Bio-mulch can be used  during   the crop cycle wherein by the end of the crop cycle the mulch gets bio-degraded leaving the farmer ready for the next cycle.  Presently non-bio degradable polymer mulches  are used  and  burnt  causing  huge environmental issues.<br/>
